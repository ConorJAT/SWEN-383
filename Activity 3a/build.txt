Activity #3a - Weather Station (w/ Observers) - Conor Race

Rather than having each UI file having its own execution sequence,
I implemented App.java, which allows for user input identical to that
of activity #2 and executes the respective UI/observer based on the
user input. Like activity #2 as well, the input is checked and secure
to ensure no bad input is added which may result in the app breaking.
