Activity #3b - Weather Station (w/ Pressure Readings) - Conor Race

Like my submission for part 3a, App.java allows for user input and 
executes the respective UI/observer based on the user input. As always, 
the input is checked and secure to ensure no bad input is added which 
may result in the app breaking.
