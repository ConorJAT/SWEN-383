Activity #2 - Weather Station (w/ Displays) - Conor Race

For my personal implementation of Activity #2, I decided to add a user
input feature that would allow the user to decide how they want the data
displayed. The key goes as follows: 1 = AWT, 2 = Swing, and 3 = Terminal.
Additionally, the program checks for any and all invalid inputs, preventing
it from crashing. All displays can be accessed in the WeatherStation.java
program file, but no two displays can run simultaneously; only one at a time.
